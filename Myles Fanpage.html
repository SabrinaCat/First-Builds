    <h4>Blended Sounds</h4>
    <p>Myles Miller's music takes influence from
         mid 70s icons such as Jimmy Hendrix. 
         The inspiration of whom can be heard 
         in many of his songs. However several 
         tracks feature the folk indie sound that
          come with the territory of living in 
          Austin, Texas. Its the energy of 70's 
          rock with the tenderness of folk indie
          all wrapped into one.</p>
